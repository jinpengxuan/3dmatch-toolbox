# 3DMatch Toolbox
3DMatch is a ConvNet-based local geometric feature descriptor that operates on 3D data (i.e. point clouds, depth maps, meshes, etc.). This toolbox provides code to use 3DMatch for geometric registration and keypoint matching, as well as code to train 3DMatch from existing RGB-D reconstructions. This is the reference implementation of our paper:

IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2017 **[Oral Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNVZl7bCjsU&list=PL_bDvITUYucADb15njRd7geem8vxOyo6N&index=3)**

Matching local geometric features on real-world depth images is a challenging task due to the noisy, low-resolution, and incomplete nature of 3D scan data. These difficulties limit the performance of current state-of-art methods, which are typically based on histograms over geometric properties. In this paper, we present 3DMatch, a data-driven model that learns a local volumetric patch descriptor for establishing correspondences between partial 3D data. To amass training data for our model, we propose an unsupervised feature learning method that leverages the millions of correspondence labels found in existing RGB-D reconstructions. Experiments show that our descriptor is not only able to match local geometry in new scenes for reconstruction, but also generalize to different tasks and spatial scales (e.g. instance-level object model alignment for the Amazon Picking Challenge, and mesh surface correspondence). Results show that 3DMatch consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin.

## Demo: Align Two Point Clouds with 3DMatch

![Demo-Teaser](demo-teaser.jpg?raw=true)

This demo aligns two 3D point clouds (projected from single-view depth maps) using our pre-trained 3DMatch descriptor (with Marvin) and standard RANSAC.

### Instructions

0. Checkout 3DMatch toolbox, compile C++/CUDA demo code and Marvin

	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/andyzeng/3dmatch-toolbox.git 3dmatch-toolbox
	cd 3dmatch-toolbox/core
	./compile.sh
	```

0. Download our 3DMatch pre-trained weights

	```shell
	./download-weights.sh # 3dmatch-weights-snapshot-137000.marvin
	```

0. Load the two example 3D point clouds, compute their TDF voxel grid volumes, and compute random surface keypoints and their 3DMatch descriptors (saved to binary files on disk). Warning: this demo only reads 3D point clouds saved in a simple binary format. If you would like to run the 3DMatch demo code on your own point cloud format, please modify demo.cu accordingly.

	```shell
	# Generate fragment-1.desc.3dmatch.bin and fragment-1.keypts.bin
	./demo ../data/sample/3dmatch-demo/single-depth-1.ply fragment-1

	# Generate fragment-2.desc.3dmatch.bin and fragment-2.keypts.bin
	./demo ../data/sample/3dmatch-demo/single-depth-2.ply fragment-2 
	```

0. Run the following script in Matlab:

	```matlab
	% Load keypoints and 3DMatch descriptors and use RANSAC to register the two
	% point clouds. A visualization of the aligned point clouds is saved into
	% the file `result.ply` which can be viewed with Meshlab or any other 3D
	% viewer. Note: there is a chance that alignment may fail on the first try
	% of this demo due to bad keypoints, which are selected randomly by default.
	demo;
	```

## Converting 3D Data to TDF Voxel Grids

Instructions on how to convert from various 3D data representations into a voxel grid of Truncated Distance Function (TDF) values.

0. Point cloud to TDF voxel grid (using nearest neighbor point distances)
 * See [C++/CUDA demo code](https://github.com/andyzeng/3dmatch-toolbox/blob/master/core/demo.cu) (ComputeTDF) which approximates TDF values (fast) using an occupancy voxel grid.
 * Alternative: See [Matlab/CUDA code](https://github.com/andyzeng/3dmatch-toolbox/blob/master/deprecated/pointCloud2AccTDF.m) which computes accurate TDF values but is very slow.
 * Alternative: See [Matlab code](https://github.com/andyzeng/3dmatch-toolbox/blob/master/evaluation/model-fitting-apc/pointCloud2TDF.m) which also computes accurate TDF values, but works standalone on Matlab. Usually runs without memory problems if your point cloud is small.

0. Mesh to TDF voxel grid (using distance transform of mesh surface with [GAPS](https://github.com/tomfunkhouser/gaps)). Note that a version of GAPS is already included in this repository.
 * Instructions on installing GAPS and converting a sample mesh (.off file) into a voxel grid (binary .raw file of floats):

	```shell
	cd 3dmatch-toolbox/gaps

	# Install GAPS
	make

	# Run msh2df on example mesh file (see comments in msh2df.cpp for more instructions)
	cd bin/x86_64
	wget http://vision.princeton.edu/projects/2016/3DMatch/downloads/gaps/bicycle000002.off
	./msh2df bicycle000002.off bicycle000002.raw -v # see comments in msh2df.cpp for more arguments

	# Download visualization script
	wget http://vision.princeton.edu/projects/2016/3DMatch/downloads/gaps/showTDF.m
	```
 * Run the visualization script in Matlab

	```matlab
	% Visualize TDF voxel grid of mesh
	showTDF;
	```

0. Depth map to TDF voxel grid
 * Project depth map into a point cloud in 3D camera space and convert from point cloud to TDF voxel grid (see above)
 * Alternative: Convert from depth map(s) into a TSDF volume (see instructions [here](#multi-frame-depth-tsdf-fusion)) and compute the absolute value of each voxel (aka. projective TDF values, which behave differently near the view boundaries and regions of missing depth)

### Demo

This demo fuses 50 registered depth maps from directory `data/sample/depth-fusion-demo/rgbd-frames` into a TSDF voxel volume, and creates a surface point cloud `tsdf.ply`

```shell
cd 3dmatch-toolbox/depth-fusion
./compile.sh

### Geometric Registration Benchmark

See folder `3dmatch-toolbox/evaluation/geometric-registration`

Includes Matlab code to run evaluation on the geometric registration benchmarks described [here](http://3dmatch.cs.princeton.edu/#geometric-registration-benchmark). Overview:
* `getKeyptsAndDesc.m` - generates intermediate data (TDF voxel volumes, keypoints, and 3DMatch descriptors) for the scene fragments. You can also download our pre-computed data [here](http://3dmatch.cs.princeton.edu/#geometric-registration-synthetic-data). 
* `runFragmentRegistration.m` - read intermediate data and run RANSAC-based registration for every pair of fragments.

* `evaluate.m` - compute precision and recall from .log files for evaluation

#### Evaluation Example

Run the following in Matlab:

```matlab
% Evaluate 3DMatch on the geometric registration benchmark
evaluate;
```

Note: the TDF voxel grids of the scene fragments from the synthetic benchmark were computed using the deprecated code for accurate TDF (see `deprecated/pointCloud2AccTDF.m`). 3DMatch pre-trained weights fine-tuned on training fragments can be downloaded [here](http://vision.princeton.edu/projects/2016/3DMatch/downloads/weights/3dmatch-weights-snapshot-127000-fragments-6000.marvin).
